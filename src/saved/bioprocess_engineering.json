The acid is drained from the reaction vessel at the rate of 15ml/s as a result of the density difference of the acid from the reacting component. To avoid wastage of acid, it is recycled to an acid tank which has 1000 L capacity. The acid drained from the reaction vessel, picks up 50 g/L solids from the reactor. Acid is fed once again to the process from acid tank. When the process is started, the acid is almost pure in the tank as a result of filtration. As the reaction proceeds, acid in the tank gets more and more contaminated with the solids. The concentration of the solids should not exceed 100 g/L from the process point of view. The batch time is 16h. Estimate whether the concentration of the solids will exceed 100g/L during the batch reaction.",
