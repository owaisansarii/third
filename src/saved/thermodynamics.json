If the heat pump under these conditions has a COP of 2.5, determine the rate at which heat is absorbed from the cold outdoor air.<img src=\"https://www.sanfoundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/thermodynamics-questions-answers-second-law-thermodynamics-q6.png\" alt=\"thermodynamics-questions-answers-second-law-thermodynamics-q6\" width=\"295\" height=\"354\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-166410\" srcset=\"https://www.sanfoundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/thermodynamics-questions-answers-second-law-thermodynamics-q6.png 295w, https://www.sanfoundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/thermodynamics-questions-answers-second-law-thermodynamics-q6-250x300.png 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 295px) 100vw, 295px\" />",
