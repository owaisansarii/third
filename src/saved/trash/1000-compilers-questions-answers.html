a) N<sup>2</sup><br>
b) 2<sup>N</sup><br>
c) 2N<br>
d) N!<br>
</b></p><i>Answer: b<br>
Explanation: The initial state of the DFA constructed from this NFA is the set of all NFA states that are reachable from state 1 by ε-moves; that is, it is the set {1, 2, and 3}. A transition from states1, 2, and 3 by input symbol 0 must follow either the arrow from state 1 to 2, or from state 3 to 4. Also, neither state 2 nor 4 have outgoing ε-moves.</i><p><b>7.

a) 35<br>
b) 360<br>
c) 49<br>
d) 720<br>
</b></p><i>Answer: b<br>
Explanation: Here string length is 4 so we create string of length 4 by 6 values firstly we arrange any value by 6 methods. Then Remaining numbers are 5 so we can arrange them by 5 methods then remaining numbers are 4 so we arrange them by 4 methods and then 3.Thus 6*5*4*3=360.</i><p><b>10.

</b></p><i>Answer: a<br>
Explanation: A compiler for a high-level language that runs on one machine and produces code for a different machine is called a cross compiler.</i><i>Answer: a<br>
Explanation: Bootstrapping to a new platform. When software is developed for a new platform, a cross compiler is used to compile necessary tools such as the OS and a native compiler.</i><i>Answer: a<br>

d) X-cross<br>
</b></p><i>Answer: b<br>
Explanation: The Canadian Cross is a technique for building cross compilers for other machines. Given three machines X, Y, and Z, one uses machine X (e.g. running Windows XP on an IA-32 processor) to build a cross compiler that runs on machine Y (e.g. running Mac OS X on an x86-64 processor) to create executables for machine Z.</i><p><b>7.  __________ was developed from the beginning as a cross compiler.<br>

c) 0 65536<br>
d) Compilation error<br>
</b></p><i>Answer: a<br>
Explanation: Consider on the expression:<br>
x = 10 +- 10u + 10u +- 10;<br>
10: It is signed integer constant.<br>
10u: It is unsigned integer constant.<br>
X: It is signed integer variable.<br>
As we know operators enjoy higher precedence than binary operators. So<br>
x = 10 + (-10u) + 10u + (-10);<br>
  = 10 + -10 + 10 + (-10);<br>
  = 0<br>
So, Corresponding signed value of unsigned 10u is +10.</i><p><b>4.

Explanation: Initially Q is empty. Then since the initial state of the DFA is {0}, {0} is added to Q.<br>
Since  2( 0 , a ) = { 1 , 2 } , { 1 , 2 } is added to Q and  ( { 0 } , a ) = { 1 , 2 }.<br>
Since  2( 0 , b ) =   ,   is added to Q and  ( { 0 } , b ) =   .<br>
At this point Q = { {0} , { 1 , 2 },   }. Similarly  ( { 1 , 2 } , b ) = { 1 , 3 } . Hence { 1 , 3 } is added to Q . Similarly  ( { 1 , 3 } , a ) = { 1 , 2 } and  ( { 1 , 3 } , b ) =   . Thus there are no new states to be added to Q . Since the transitions from all states of Q have been computed and no more states are added to Q, the conversion process stops here. </i><i>Answer: b<br>

c) The information from data flow analysis cannot otherwise be used for optimization<br>
d) The information from the front end cannot otherwise be used for optimization<br>
</b></p><i>Answer: b<br>
Explanation: Code optimizations are carried out on the intermediate code because program analysis is more accurate on intermediate code than on machine code. </i><i>Answer: a<br>
Explanation: I. Statement is false since global variables are required for recursions with static storage. This is due to unavailability of stack in static storage. II. This is true III. In dynamic allocation heap structure is used, so it is false. IV. False since recursion can be implemented. V. Statement is completely true. So only II &amp; V are true. </i><p><b>8.

c) The LR(0) parser for G has S-R conflicts<br>
d) The LALR(1) parser for G has reduce-reduce conflicts<br>
</b></p><i>Answer: b<br>
Explanation: LALR parser is reduced form of CLR or LR(1) parser, LALR parser uses the LR(1) items of CLR parser &amp; of any shift reduce conflicts are there then it is due to LR(1) parser.</i><i>Answer: b<br>
Explanation: I. Statement is true since there are some parsers which take 0 (n log2n) times for parsing. II. Completely false, since there is no use of stack which is required for recursion. III.
