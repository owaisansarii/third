a) Sub-mask<br>
b) Mask<br>
c) Pixel phasing<br>
d) Pixel weighting<br>
</b></p><i> Answer: c<br>
Explanation: None.<br>
</i><p><b>12. The technique that is  more accurate method for anti-aliasing lines is<br>
a) Filtering<br>
b) Area-sampling<br>
c) Super-sampling<br>
d) None<br>
</b></p><i> Answer: a<br>
Explanation: In this technique we can imagine a continuous weighting surface covering the pixel.<br>
</i><p><b>13. Super-sampling methods can be applied by<br>
a) Sub-dividing the total area<br>
b) Determining the number of sub-pixels inside the area<br>
c) Both a and b<br>
d) Only b<br>
</b></p><i> Answer: c<br>
Explanation: Super-sampling methods can be applied by sub-dividing the total area and determining the number of sub-pixels inside the area boundary.<br>
</i><p><b>14. Another method for determining the percentage of pixel area within a boundary is<br>
a) Mid-print algorithm<br>
b) Mid-point algorithm<br>
c) Pixel intensity<br>
d) By using inquiry functions<br>
</b></p><i> Answer: b<br>
Explanation: This algorithm selects the next pixel along a line by determining which of 2 pixels is closer to the line between 2 pixels.<br>
</i><p><b>15. What is the use of Coherence techniques along and between scan lines?<br>
a) To simplify the calculations<br>
b) To determine the area edges<br>
c) To find polygon region<br>
d) To correct interior area<br>
</b></p><i> Answer: a<br>
Explanation: Coherence techniques are used along and between scan lines to simplify the calculations.<br>
